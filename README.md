# Harvard Open Data Portal
## Mission Statement
The goal of the Harvard Open Data Project (HODP) is to leverage open data to foster community, efficiency, and student innovation. Making data public and easily accessible allows us all to unlock its potential. Data-driven progress unites people, organizations, and departments as we all try to make daily life better. Aggregating, maintaining, and publicizing open data has and will continue to be a global trend and we want Harvard to be at its forefront. Our goal is to give that progress a home with centralization of available data, integration with existing systems, and showcases of data-inspired products.

## About
Students from across the University are spearheading a project to build Harvard's first open data portal, which will empower Harvard students and researchers to discover and hack with University data like financial data, enrollment stats, course catalogs, and more.

We've teamed up with Harvard's Chief Technology Officer and Chief Digital Officer along with the former deputy CTO of the US. We're now looking for students with expertise in fields ranging from technology to policy to build a cross-functional team for the project.

Join us to make more university data accessible, build a web frontend for the data portal, and create interesting visualizations and apps using our data. It's a great opportunity to expand your skill set while building an enduring platform for the Harvard community.

## Past Work
There has been a large movement toward open data in government (e.g. [Data.gov](http://data.gov)) and in other universities (e.g. [Yale's Open Data Access Project](http://yoda.yale.edu/)). The Harvard administration has been working on an open data portal of our own for nearly two years, and by finally bringing together all the necessary people (faculty leaders and undergraduate builders and researchers) we are finally making this a reality.

## Faculty Leadership
- Nick Sinai, former United States Deputy CTO
- Jim Waldo, CTO, Harvard University
- Perry Hewitt, Chief Digital Officer, Harvard University

## Current Status
We've found some really interesting data sets around Harvard and have compiled metadata about each. We're in the process of uploading them to a backend which uses Harvard's Dataverse, and we're working on a frontend app that'll let users interface with this data.

## Next Steps
- Finding interesting, accessible data sets around harvard.edu
- Working out open licensing for the data
- Determining which technology to use to store and catalog the data
- Building a frontend and backend for the data portal

## Possible Data Sets
- Q scores
- Course catalog
- Shuttle tracker
- Dining hall menus
- Demographics from the FAS Registrar
- Endowment
- Library search
- Harvard art museum collections
- Building plans for Allston
- Authentication
- [DASH research repository](http://dash.harvard.edu/)

## A few datasets we've found so far
- Course enrollment stats for every semester since 1999
- Harvard Dining Services menus
- 3D models of Harvard buildings
- Harvard Police daily crime Log
- Financial aid records
- Faculty and staff demographics
- Annual fire safety report
- Endowment stats

## Running the app
To set up the app, run the following in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/Harvard-Open-Data-Project/hodp.git
npm install
```

And to run the app:

```
npm start
```
