![Droid logo](droid-logo.png)

Building Harvard University's first open data portal.

## About

Work with Harvard's CTO and the former Deputy CTO of the United States to create an open platform where Harvard students and researchers can discover and access data about the University!

This portal will be featured on the main Harvard website , and could feature everything from dining menus, to shuttle schedules, to the course catalog.  Hackers and data lovers welcome!
