# Harvard Open Data Portal
## About
Students from across the University are spearheading a project to build Harvard's first open data portal, which will empower Harvard students and researchers to discover and hack with University data like course catalogs, library holdings, and more.

We've teamed up with Harvard's Chief Technology Officer and Chief Digital Officer along with the former deputy CTO of the US. We're now looking for students with expertise in fields ranging from technology to policy to build a cross-functional team for the project.

Join us to make more university data accessible, build a web frontend for the data portal, and create interesting visualizations and apps using our data. It's a great opportunity to expand your skill set while building an enduring platform for the Harvard community.

Open meetings in **Sever 111 on Fridays 12:00-1:30pm; free lunch provided**. Contact neelmehta@college.harvard.edu with questions.

## Past Work
There has been a large movement toward open data in government (e.g. [Data.gov](http://data.gov)) and in other universities (e.g. [Yale's Open Data Access Project](http://yoda.yale.edu/)). The Harvard administration has been working on an open data portal of our own for nearly two years, and by finally bringing together all the necessary people (faculty leaders and undergraduate builders and researchers) we are finally making this a reality.

## Leadership
- Jim Waldo, CTO, Harvard University
- Perry Hewitt, Chief Digital Officer, Harvard University
- Nick Sinai, former United States Deputy CTO

## Next Steps
- Finding interesting, accessible data sets around harvard.edu
- Working out open licensing for the data
- Determining which technology to use to store and catalog the data
- Building a frontend and backend for the data portal
