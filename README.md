# Harvard Droid: "Digital Repository of Open Interesting Data"

![Droid logo](droid-logo.png)

Building Harvard University's first open data portal.

## About Droid

We (Harvard's CTO, the former Deputy CTO of the United States, and Harvard College students, among others) are creating an open platform where Harvard students and researchers can discover data about the University such as course catalogs, energy consumption, and library holdings.

We're going to find, store, and publish exciting data sets about Harvard and build a technical platform that'll help visitors find and use this data at a click. We're looking for data lovers and hackers from around the University -- especially undergraduates -- to make this a reality.
