On a very positive note, robbery and aggravated assault have seen a steady decline in frequency over a three year span. Unfortunately, dating violence and stalking have increased continually. Rape and burglary reached an all time high at the end of 2014 after reaching an all time low in 2013."

Data-driven progress unites people, organizations, and departments as we all try to make daily life better. Aggregating, maintaining, and publicizing open data has and will continue to be a global trend and we want Harvard to be at its forefront. Our goal is to give that progress a home with centralization of available data, integration with existing systems, and showcases of data-inspired products."
